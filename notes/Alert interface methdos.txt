Alert interface methods

accept() - clicks on OK button of the alert

dismiss() - clicks on cancel button of the alert if it contains 
else it click ok button of alert

getText() returns String value i.e. the text of alert

sendKeys(String arg) send some data to the text field of alert if 
it contains any

To handle alerts we have to Switch driver focus from web page to the
alert using switchTo() of WebDriver interface.
This switchTo() returns TargetLocator interface reference
This TargetLocator is in inner interface of WebDriver interface and it 
contains several methods to switch driver focus from current web page 
to specified things (like an alert or an active element in the page or
to frame or to a child window)

TargetLocator tl = driver.switchTo();
Alert alert = tl.alert();

to write above lines of code in single line
Alert alert = driver.switchTo().alert();
